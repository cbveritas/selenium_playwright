# Selenium and Playwrigth basic script

This project provides two Python scripts that scrape flight information from LATAM's website for flights from Bogot√° (BOG) to Cartagena (CTG). Both scripts demonstrate the use of two popular web scraping frameworks: Selenium and Playwright.

# Overview

1. **selenium_script.py**: Uses Selenium with ChromeDriver to load the LATAM flight offers page in headless mode, waits for the page to load, and scrapes information about each flight.
2. **playwright_script.py**: Uses Playwright in headless mode to achieve the same objective, highlighting an alternative approach with a modern browser automation framework.

These scripts are ideal for demonstrations or quick scraping tasks where dynamic content rendering requires a browser interaction, such as JavaScript-rendered content.


## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Google Chrome** (for `selenium_script.py`)
- **Node.js** (for Playwright)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
   git clone git@github.com:cbveritas/selenium_playwright.git
   cd selenium_playwright
```

2. Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Install the Playwright browsers if not installed:
```bash
playwright install
```

4. How to Run
## Running the Selenium Script
```bash
python selenium_script.py
```

## Running the Playwright Script
```bash
python playwrigth_script.py
```
## Code Highlights
### Selenium Script
Configures Chrome to run headlessly, using webdriver-manager to simplify driver management.
Uses WebDriverWait with expected conditions to handle dynamic loading of elements.
Demonstrates error handling with try-except blocks for cases when elements may not load.

### Playwright Script
Uses Playwright's sync API for synchronous browser control.
Waits for the flight elements using wait_for_selector.
Demonstrates a streamlined approach with query_selector_all for element selection.


## Troubleshooting
- ChromeDriver errors (Selenium): Ensure Chrome is installed and compatible with the ChromeDriver version.
- Playwright errors: Ensure Node.js is installed, as Playwright may need it to install browsers.


## Dependencies
- selenium: For automating browser interactions.
- webdriver-manager: To manage browser drivers automatically.
- playwright: For streamlined browser automation.
